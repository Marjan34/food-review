              The best pizza we ever had in (City)!! The pizza was so delicious
              and with so many flavor could choose that we even visited the
              pizza shop twice in the same day! You could just take away or
              standing finish your pizza in the store.

              Burger King is an American fast food chain is located at Road 11
              in Banani. They are famous for their Burger and have many other
              good fast food options also in their menu. We tried their Cheesy
              Beef Burger, Crispy Chicken Burger, BBQ chicken wings, French
              fries, Coke and Cone ice cream. All the items were good and tasty.
              This shop is mainly a very good place for the youngsters and
              tourists, who are burger lovers. The staffs are good, helpful and
              efficient with good atmosphere
